Whaling Quota Software:

WhaleQuotaCalc.m contains the script that will determine the optimal
whaling quotas for a given year. To run, simply set the values in the
vectors r, K, a, and prices. In each vector, the first entry corresponds to
blue whales, and the second entry corresponds to fin whales. Then, set the
starting populations in the currentPopulation vector. If the situation is
constrained by the IWC, set the following three variables
accordingly. Running the script will now generate the optimal populations
and the whaling quotas to get there or stay there, depending on the current
conditions.
